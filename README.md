# **About Me**

Through my journey in Flutter development, I have encountered and overcome a wide range of challenges—rewriting codebases, optimizing performance, and refining architectures. These experiences have shaped my development style into one that prioritizes clarity, scalability, and long-term maintainability.

I strive not only to build functional applications but to create solutions that are robust, efficient, and ready to grow with user and business needs.
